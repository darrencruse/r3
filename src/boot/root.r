    Purpose: {
        Root system values. This context is hand-made very early at boot time
        to allow it to hold key system values during boot up. Most of these
        are put here to prevent them from being garbage collected.

;; Tags used in the native-optimized versions of user-function-generators
;; FUNC and PROC

with-tag        ; <with> for no locals gather (disables RETURN/LEAVE in FUNC)
ellipsis-tag    ; FUNC+PROC use as alternative to [[]] to mark varargs
opt-tag         ; FUNC+PROC use as alternative to _ to mark optional void? args
end-tag         ; FUNC+PROC use as alternative to | to mark endable args
local-tag       ; marks the beginning of a list of "pure locals"
durable-tag     ; !!! In progress - argument word lookup survives call ending
tight-tag       ; Argument completes shortest legal expression (not longest)
