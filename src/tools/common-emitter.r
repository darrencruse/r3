; !!! %make-headers.r has a dependency on BUF-EMIT, because in addition to
; just outputting data it also merges #ifdef/#endif, and does so on two files
; at once.  That suggests that the emitter really needs to be an object so
; you can run multiple emit instances at once without overwriting each other,
; but the primitive bootstrap scripts weren't prepared for this case.  For
; now, the buffer is exposed.
