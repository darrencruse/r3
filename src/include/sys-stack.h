**
**  Summary: REBOL Stack Definitions
**  Module:  sys-stack.h
**  Notes:
**
**  This contains the definitions for the DATA STACK (DS_*)
**
**  The data stack is mostly for REDUCE and COMPOSE, which use it
**  as a common buffer for values that are being gathered to be
**  inserted into another series.  It's better to go through this
**  buffer step because it means the precise size of the new
**  insertions are known ahead of time.  If a series is created,
**  it will not waste space or time on expansion, and if a series
**  is to be inserted into as a target, the proper size gap for
**  the insertion can be opened up exactly once (without any
**  need for repeatedly shuffling on individual insertions).
**
**  Beyond that purpose, the data stack can also be used as a
**  place to store a value to protect it from the garbage
**  collector.  The stack must be balanced in the case of success
**  when a native or action runs.  But if `fail` is used to trigger
**  an error, then the stack will be automatically balanced in
**  the trap handling.
**
**  The data stack specifically needs contiguous memory for its
**  applications.  That is more important than having stability
**  of pointers to any data on the stack.  Hence if any push or
**  pops can happen, there is no guarantee that the pointers will
**  remain consistent...as the memory buffer may need to be
**  reallocated (and hence relocated).  The index positions will
**  remain consistent, however: and using DSP and DS_AT it is
**  possible to work with stack items by index.
**
**  Note: The requirements for the call stack differ from the data
**  stack, due to a need for pointer stability.  Being an ordinary
**  series, the data stack will relocate its memory on expansion.
**  This creates problems for natives and actions where pointers to
**  parameters are saved to variables from D_ARG(N) macros.  These
**  would need a refresh after every potential expanding operation.
**
***********************************************************************/


/***********************************************************************
**
**  At the moment, the data stack is *mostly* implemented as a typical
**  series.  Pushing unfilled slots on the stack (via PUSH_TRASH_UNSAFE)
**  partially inlines Alloc_Tail_List, so it only pays for the function
**  call in cases where expansion is necessary.
**
**  When Rebol was first open-sourced, there were other deviations from
**  being a normal series.  It was not terminated with an END, so
**  you would be required to call a special DS_TERMINATE() routine to
**  put the terminator in place before using the data stack with a
**  routine that expected termination.  It also had to be expanded
**  manually, so a DS_PUSH was not guaranteed to trigger a potential
**  growth of the stack--if expansion hadn't been anticipated with a
**  large enough space for that push, it would corrupt memory.
**
**  Overall, optimizing the stack structure should be easier now that
**  it has a more dedicated purpose.  So those tricks are not being
**  used for the moment.  Future profiling can try those and other
**  approaches when a stable and complete system has been achieved.

//
// CHUNK STACK
//
// Like the data stack, the values living in the chunk stack are protected
// from garbage collection.
//
// Unlike the data stack, the chunk stack allows for the pushing and popping
// of arbitrary-sized arrays of values which will not be relocated during
// their lifetime.
//
// This is accomplished using a custom "chunked" allocator.  The two structs
// involved are a list of "Chunkers", which internally have a list of
// "Chunks" threaded between them.  The method keeps one spare chunker
// allocated, and only frees a chunker when a full chunker prior has the last
// element popped out of it.  In memory it looks like this:
//
//      [chunker->next
//          (->payload_left size [value1][value2][value3]...)   // chunk 1
//          (->payload_left size [value1]...)                   // chunk 2
//          (->payload_left size [value1][value2]...)           // chunk 3
//          ...remaining payload space in chunker...
//      ]
//
// Since the chunker size is a known constant, it's possible to quickly deduce
// the chunker a chunk lives in from its pointer and the remaining payload
// amount in the chunker.

// The compiler will *not* optimize out const pointers as captures of the

// would pay for both a pointer variable *and* an assignment each call:
//
//     REBVAL * const foo = ARG(1);
//
//     if (IS_INTEGER(foo))) { ... }
//
// The real way to get peak performance with no extra storage or cost of
// assignment is to instead declare an integer constant and use the macro
// each time:
//
//     const int foo = 1;
//
//     if (IS_INTEGER(ARG(foo))) { ... }
//

//     REFINE(2, bar);
//

//
// Under the hood `PARAM(1, foo)` and `REFINE(2, bar)` declare structs.
// In an optimized build, these structures disappear completely, with all
// addressing done directly into the call frame's cached `vars` pointer.
//
// To aid in debugging, the debug build version of the structures contain
// the actual pointers to the arguments.  It also keeps a copy of a cache
// of the type for the arguments, because the bitfields inside of a REBVAL
// must be integer and hence don't show the name of the type.  Whether
// a refinemnent was in use or not at the time of the call is also cached.
