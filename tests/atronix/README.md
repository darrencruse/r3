These were some non-GUI-related tests which were pulled from Atronix's
r3 repository during the Ren/C refactoring.  They lived underneath
the make/ directory.

Ren/C includes the test repository as a submodule, hence these tests
can at least be found by a process which needs them.

It is not currently clear at time of writing exactly which non-GUI
features the Ren/C library will choose to support.  Erring on the side
of being usable by Atronix for their work is clearly favorable.
